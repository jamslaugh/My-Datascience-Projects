# Scripts

The scripts present in this folder are part of some analysis I performed for some local firms.\
The analysis all ended in reports, which cannot be published since are internal intelligence docs.

Files as **Scraping_data.py** and **Var_sel_GBM_GLMB.R** are exercises that I've performed in order to gather country data from CIA world factbook open data, the first, and practice on some Machine learning, the second.

**Id function.R** is a function I have implemented as standalone script, used to get id codes from a google scholar search. This code has been developed in **rvest-scholar moddedV1.R**, which is a modified script from R package "scholar" by @ckreibich. 

## Future implementations:

I am actually collaborating with University of Napoli Federico II, with professor Aria. As soon as the R package we are working on is ready, I will publish it in a new branch.

More projects I am currently working on, will publish as soon as I can.
