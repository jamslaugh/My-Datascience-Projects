# Scripts

The scripts present in this file are part of some analysis I performed for some local firms.\
The analysis all ended in reports, which cannot be published since are internal intelligence docs.

Files as **Scraping_data.py** and **Var_sel_GBM_GLMB.R** are exercises that I'm performing in order to gather country data from CIA world factbook open data, the first, and practice on some Machine learning, the second.
